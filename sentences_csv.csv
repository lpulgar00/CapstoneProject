336,"For example, fabrication issues such as the deviation from a true circular form in pipe (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cpeaking\xe2\x80\x9d at longitudinal weld seams) or offset at the weld joint can cause\nan increase in stress that may result in reduced service life, and control of these deviations is recommended.\n\n(2)33"
